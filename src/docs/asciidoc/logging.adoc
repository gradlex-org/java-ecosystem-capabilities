= Logging Capabilities Gradle Plugin

This plugin provides a DSL that enables an application to declaratively enforce _at build time_ the logging framework it decided to use.
See the <<index.adoc#intro,general introduction>> for the motivation for this plugin.

== Plugin application and compatibility

The plugin can be applied to projects using Gradle 6.8.3 and later.

[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
  id("org.gradlex.logging-capabilities") version "2.0"
}
----

Have a look at https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/dev.jacomet.logging-capabilities[the documentation on the plugin portal] for alternate or DSL specific syntax.

The application will make sure that the <<base.adoc#base-plugin,capabilities definition plugin>> has been applied as well, either as a settings or project plugin.
This base plugin is the one that defines a number of Java ecosystem capabilities, including <<rules.adoc#logging,ones covering the logging landscape>>.

== Expressing preference over a logging solution

The plugin contributes a project extension that allows to configure which logging solution to use in a declarative fashion.

The extension is accessed as follows:

[source,kotlin]
----
// Assuming the plugin has been applied
loggingCapabilities {
    // Configuration goes here
}
----

TIP: The different configuration options documented below do not _add_ dependencies.
Make sure to have the expected dependency in your graph, either as a direct or transitive one.

The plugin first provides a number of high-level, one stop solutions, for selecting a logging solution:

|===
| Method | Documentation | Required dependency

| `enforceLogback()` +
`enforceLogback(String configurationName)`
| This will configure all capabilities to resolve in favour of http://logback.qos.ch/[LOGBack] and route all alternative logging solutions through Slf4J.
| `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic`

| `enforceLog4J2()` +
`enforceLog4J2(String configurationName)`
| This will configure all capabilities to resolve in favour of http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4J 2] and route all alternative logging solutions through Log4J 2.
| `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`

| `enforceSlf4JSimple()` +
`enforceSlf4JSimple(String configurationName)`
| This will configure all capabilities to resolve in favour of Slf4J simple and route all alternative logging solutions through Slf4J.
| `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`

|===

TIP: The method without parameter will apply the setup to all dependency configuration, while the other one will limit the setup to the specified dependency configuration.

If you want a finer grained control, the plugin provides lower level entry points for solving the different logging capability conflicts:
|===
| Method | Accepted parameter values | Documentation

| `selectSlf4JBinding(Object notation)`
| Value must be an Slf4J binding implementation known by the plugin: `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jcl`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14`, `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic` or `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`
| Configures the provided Slf4J binding for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed

| `selectSlf4JBinding(String configurationName, Object notation)`
| A dependency configuration name, that `canBeResolved=true` +
A notation as above
| Configures the provided Slf4J binding for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed, only for the provided dependency configuration

| `selectLog4J12Implementation(Object notation)`
| Value must be a Log4J 1.2 implementation known by the plugin: `org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-1.2-api`, `log4:log4j` or `org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12`
| Configures the provided Log4J 1.2 implementation for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed

| `selectLog4J12Implementation(String configurationName, Object notation)`
| A dependency configuration name, that `canBeResolved=true` +
A notation as above
| Configures the provided Log4J 1.2 implementation for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed, only for the provided dependency configuration

| `selectJulDelegation(Object notation)`
| Value must be a `java.util.logging` interceptor or binding known by the plugin: `org.slf4j:jul-to-slf4j`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14` or `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jul`
| Configures the provided JUL integration of binding for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed

| `selectJulDelegation(String configurationName, Object notation)`
| A dependency configuration name, that `canBeResolved=true` +
A notation as above
| Configures the provided JUL integration for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed, only for the provided dependency configuration

| `selectJCLImplementation(Object notation)`
| Value must be a Apache Commons Logging interceptor or binding known by the plugin: `org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j`, `commons-logging:commons-logging`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jcl` or `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jcl`
| Configures the provided commons logging interceptor or binding for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed

| `selectJCLImplementation(String configurationName, Object notation)`
| A dependency configuration name, that `canBeResolved=true` +
A notation as above
| Configures the provided commons logging interceptor or binding for selection, configuring related capabilities if needed, only for the provided dependency configuration

| `selectSlf4JLog4J2Interaction(Object notation)`
| Value must be a Log4J 2 module for Slf4J interaction known by the plugin: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j` or `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`
| Configures the Log4J 2 / Slf4J integration, configuring related capabilities if needed

| `selectSlf4JLog4J2Interaction(Sting configurationName, Object notation)`
| A dependency configuration name, that `canBeResolved=true` +
A notation as above
| Configures the Log4J 2 / Slf4J integration, configuring related capabilities if needed, only for the provided dependency configuration

TIP: Notations above are those accepted by https://docs.gradle.org/6.0.1/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler:create(java.lang.Object)[`DependencyHandler.create(notation)`] in Gradle that resolves to an `ExternalDependency`.
Most often this is a `group:name:version` `String`.
