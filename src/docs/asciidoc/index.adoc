This plugin adds https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/component_capabilities.html#capabilities_as_first_level_concept[Capabilities]
to the metadata of well-known components hosted on Maven Central that are used in many Java projects.

== What is a 'Capability' in Gradle and why should I care?

In the videos below,
I explain the concept of Capability Conflicts and why they can help you to avoid "dependency hell" in your project.
With this plugin, you enable Gradle to detect and automatically resolved typical capability conflicts in the Java Ecosystem.

== How to use the plugin?

Apply the plugin to all (sub)projects of your build so that the capability-adding rules are active everywhere.
There is nothing else you need to do. The rules will now be considered when dependencies are resolved.
For general information about how to structure Gradle builds, and apply community plugins like this one to all subprojects,
you can check out my https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N95YI-szd78&list=PLWQK2ZdV4Yl2k2OmC_gsjDpdIBTN0qqkE[Understanding Gradle video series].
