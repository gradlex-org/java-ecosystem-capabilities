These plugins add https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/component_capabilities.html#capabilities_as_first_level_concept[dependency capabilities]
to the metadata of well-known components hosted on Maven Central that are used in many Java projects.
They also provide ways to resolve the potential capability conflict that can happen in the dependency graph of your application.

== What is a dependency 'Capability' in Gradle and why should I care?

* Ever seen this infamous Slf4J warning?

----
SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:.../slf4j-log4j12-1.7.29.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:.../logback-classic-1.2.3.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.
SLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]

* Ever wondered how to make sure _all_ your dependencies' logging ends up in your Log4J 2 configured outputs?
* Ever had to handle a `javax` to `jakarta` migration and wondered how to make sure all your dependencies are compatible?

In the videos below, https://github.com/jjohannes[Jendrik] explains the concept of Capability Conflicts and why they can help you to avoid "dependency hell" in your project.

NOTE: With this series of plugins, you enable your build to detect and automatically resolve typical capability conflicts in the Java Ecosystem.

== Plugins

TIP: These plugins require Gradle 6.8.3 at a minimum.

The benefits described above are achieved through three different plugins:

`org.gradlex.java-ecosystem-capabilities-base`::
<<base-plugin,This plugin>> adds capability declarations to the metadata of well-known components hosted on Maven Central that are used in many Java projects.
This plugin can be applied as a `Settings` or a `Project` plugin.

`org.gradlex.java-ecosystem-capabilities`::
<<ecosystem-plugin,This plugin>> adds opinionated capability resolutions to conflicting API or implementation libraries in the Java ecosystem.
This plugin can be applied as a `Project` plugin.

`org.gradlex.logging-capabilities`::
<<logging-plugin,This plugin>> adds a DSL to select logging implementation for your application.
This plugin can be applied as a `Project` plugin.

See each plugin's documentation for more details.
